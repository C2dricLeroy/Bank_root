# Technicals 

## Description 

In this file, you'll find some informations about the tools used in this project. 

## Language 

In this project, we decide to use **Javascript**. 

Javascript is one of the most popular language for designigs APIs and work on web projects. 

We do not choose Typescript in this project bacause we don't currently work with it. 

However, our code follow most of the ES6 recommandations. 

## Backend Framework

With the objectif of designing an API for our client, the use of a Framework is a necessity as it allow us to save time in the same time as structuring our project.

We choose to work with **NestJS**, a Node.js open-source framework. On the first hand it's a poular and robust framework, on the other hand we need to lear it for future projects. 

## Database Manager

Our project works with a relationnal Database. 

We choose to work with the most powerful and popular database manager : **PostgreSQL**. 

## ORM

The use of an ORM is useful as it allows you to securize your DB and save time. 

We choose to work with **TypeORM** beacause it's a Javascript ORM that also support TypeScript. This ORM also got a good community, support, and is well documented. 
It also be useful for future projects. 

## Front-end

In the phase of conception, we though we would use Angular for this project. 

## Deployment 

We choose to deploy our application using **Docker**.
